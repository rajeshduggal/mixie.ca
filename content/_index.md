## Here's the problem...

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: larger;">Your team is following all the software development best practices. But you're still not getting the expected results. Whatâ€™s going on!?</p>

<p style="font-size: larger">You feel like you're always having to explain why the team is behind schedule and over budget.</i></p>

* New software features arenâ€™t being delivered on time. Deadlines are being missed!
* The software has bugs! And everyone's pointing fingers.
* The team is feeling pressure, stress, and frustration!

## There must be a better way

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: larger;">Shouldn't our software development practices bring us celebratory success and delight, not stress and confusion?</p>

<p style="font-size: larger">Imagine receiving praise and reward for delivering software <i>on time</i> that the users are <i>excited about and love using!</i></p>

* Imagine the excitement of hitting every sprint goal on time.
* Imagine the satisfaction of delivering a set of features that the users love.
* Imagine the confidence gained from a smooth and successful deployment.
* Imagine the joy of seeing customer feedback glow with appreciation.
* Imagine the thrill of celebrating the team's collaboration and effort.
* Imagine the empowerment of delivering continuous value to the business.
* Imagine the anticipation for the next sprint, energized by success.

## Use Software Building Practices That Work
Have your team focus on the right practices that work, not just following the usual standard conventions.

Iâ€™ve got bad news... __youâ€™ve been lied to.__

Youâ€™ve been led to believe that completing the scrum ceremonies and using sophisticated project management tools is going to get your project launched on-time and within the allotted budget.

But thatâ€™s simply not true.

__Launching on-time and within budget requires practices that recognize that quality is a variable, and are optimized for  effectively embracing change throughout the project, instead of optimizing purely for efficiency.__

Stakeholders and customers donâ€™t want to hear excuses.

They want results.

In fact, the faster you can deliver the working software they want, the more likely theyâ€™ll continue the project and ask for more releases.

And best of all?

This establishes a positive feedback loop, enhancing the team's effectiveness and boosting confidence by ensuring alignment with stakeholder expectations.

## Raj Duggal
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: larger;">
Hi! Iâ€™m Raj Duggal, and I help software building teams deliver working software on-time and within budget by optimizing their processes and practices.
</p>

With __over two decades of experience as a software development consultant__, Iâ€™ve worked on projects for the major Canadian banks in Toronto, as well as venture-funded startups in Silicon Valley. My client list includes well-known names like Disney, IBM, Scotiabank, and many more.


Iâ€™ve guided teams towards achieving greater cohesion and introduced practices that work to consistently deliver successful, incremental releases. My real-world experience has taught me that effective software development is rooted in adaptability and collaboration.

In recent years, the software industry has shifted back toward pre-agile practices while still using agile terminology. __Iâ€™m on a mission to help teams rediscover the fundamentals of agile that focuses on embracing change.__

Ready to join me on this journey? Youâ€™ll be glad you did. ðŸ˜Š
