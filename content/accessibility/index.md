title: "AODA Accessibility & Document Remediation"

__Digital accessibility isn't just about compliance - it's about making sure everyone can access and use your content, no matter their abilities.__

At Mixie, we help organizations ensure their websites and documents meet accessibility standards so they're usable, inclusive, and legally compliant.

There are some fantastic tools out there that can catch many accessibility issues, and Mixie makes full use of them. But real accessibility goes beyond automation. To truly know if something is accessible, it needs to be tested and reviewed by a human - someone who can understand how a person with assistive technology actually experiences your site or document. That's where Mixie comes in.

In Ontario, the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) sets clear standards for making websites and published materials accessible. Other regions have similar laws and guidelines. If you're not sure whether your digital content meets those standards, we can help. Just share what you need reviewed - a website, a web app, or a batch of documents - and we'll assess what's needed, provide a clear fixed-price quote, and handle the remediation. The result is accessible, compliant digital content that everyone can use and enjoy.
