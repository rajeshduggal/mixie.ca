Chrome has a built in tool called [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview) which can audit the web page you're visiting in both desktop browser and mobile browser modes.


## Step 1. Open the built in [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools)

## Step 3. Configure the test report

Check the "Accesibility" Checkbox, and run the test for either how the web page will be displayed in desktop computer mode, or mobile phone mode. Then click the "Analyze page load" button, and it will start analyzing the web page and generate a report.
