[{"content":"Help your software team embrace change, improve flow, and focus on delivering real value.\nAgile isn\u0026rsquo;t about sticking to a rigid process - it\u0026rsquo;s about embracing change. At Mixie, we help software teams and their stakeholders work together in a way that keeps the focus where it belongs: on delivering real value to end users.\nMany teams rely heavily on tools like JIRA or Git and call it \u0026ldquo;Agile,\u0026ldquo;but true agility is a mindset. It\u0026rsquo;s about creating an environment where stakeholders can confidently shift priorities, and developers are ready to adapt - both technically and process-wise. That means having solid foundations like automated tests and version control, but also giving the team room to explore better solutions without pressure to hit arbitrary deadlines. Progress shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be measured by the number of features shipped, but by the impact those features make.\nWhen we work together, we\u0026rsquo;ll start by observing how your team currently operates - from planning to delivery - and identify practical changes that can make your process more adaptable, transparent, and effective. We don\u0026rsquo;t run your meetings or lead your ceremonies; instead, we provide clear, actionable feedback and guidance you can apply right away.\nThis service is offered on a monthly fixed-price retainer, giving your team consistent access to coaching and advice as you grow into a truly agile way of working.\n","permalink":"https://mixie.ca/agile-coaching/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHelp your software team embrace change, improve flow, and focus on delivering real value.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgile isn\u0026rsquo;t about sticking to a rigid process - it\u0026rsquo;s about embracing change.

But real accessibility goes beyond automation. To truly know if something is accessible, it needs to be tested and reviewed by a human - someone who can understand how a person with assistive technology actually experiences your site or document. That\u0026rsquo;s where Mixie comes in.\nIn Ontario, the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) sets clear standards for making websites and published materials accessible. Other regions have similar laws and guidelines. If you\u0026rsquo;re not sure whether your digital content meets those standards, we can help. Just share what you need reviewed - a website, a web app, or a batch of documents - and we\u0026rsquo;ll assess what\u0026rsquo;s needed, provide a clear fixed-price quote, and handle the remediation. The result is accessible, compliant digital content that everyone can use and enjoy.\n","permalink":"https://mixie.ca/accessibility/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDigital accessibility isn\u0026rsquo;t just about compliance - it\u0026rsquo;s about making sure everyone can access and use your content, no matter their abilities.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Mixie, we help organizations ensure their websites and documents meet accessibility standards so they\u0026rsquo;re usable, inclusive, and legally compliant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are some fantastic tools out there that can catch many accessibility issues, and Mixie makes full use of them.

Your software should be too.\nNot every problem needs brand-new software - but when it does, it should be built with purpose. The Mixie team will help you find the most efficient path to the right solution. Sometimes that means discovering existing tools or platforms that already meet your needs. Other times, it means combining and customizing off-the-shelf systems with a bit of smart \u0026ldquo;glue\u0026rdquo; to connect everything together into a smooth, automated workflow. And in rare cases, it means designing and building a fully custom application from the ground up.\nEvery project begins with a deep understanding of your goals, the outcomes you\u0026rsquo;re seeking, and the value a solution will create for your business. From there, we agree upon a fixed-price engagement with a 100% money-back gurantee, that reflects the results (not the hours) required to get you there.\nWe only take on projects we\u0026rsquo;re confident we can complete successfully. If the project isn\u0026rsquo;t right for Mixie, we can help you find someone else that might be a better fit.\nTo accelerate delivery and maximize results, we leverage the latest AI tools from Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic. These tools make it possible to rapidly deliver a prototype which we can then iterate on, transforming ideas into working software faster than ever before.
